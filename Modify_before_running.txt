You need to change the following:

Email_Sender.py (send_email function):
- insert the password of the gmail account that you want to send the email from (RECOMMEND to create a new account)
- insert the e-mail address of the gmail account that you want to send the email from

Collectors_Scrapper.py (main body):
- insert the sender and receipient email addresses (in the message creation)

TIP: the *.bat file can be used with the Windows Scheduler to run the script as often as you like
Must change the paths in that file (python and script paths)
